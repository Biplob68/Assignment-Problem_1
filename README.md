### Problem 
I am starting a small business. So, I need to keep a ledger for all the buys, sells, and available balances on my account. When I run the program, it will be able to accept command line inputs. And, will show the result in the command line. When engaging with the command line, it will give me options to add a product, delete a product, buy a product, sell a product, see the list of the product, and see the available balance.
