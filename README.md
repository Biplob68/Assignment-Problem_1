## Problem: 
#### I am starting a small business. So, I need to keep a ledger for all the buys, sells, and available balances on my account. When I run the program, it will be able to accept command line inputs. And, will show the result in the command line. When engaging with the command line, it will give me options to add a product, delete a product, buy a product, sell a product, see the list of the product, and see the available balance. 

## Solution:
##### Here,  I have created 4 java class- main class, Product Class, ProductList class, and Small Shop class. I have divided my task into 3 classes mainly. 

### Product Class: 
The product class contains different types of variables and methods of the product. It contains the product name, buying price, selling price, and total available products in the inventory. product class also contains some methods to access some attributes.  

### Product List class: 
It is an ArrayList and it contains the total number of products that are added, deleted, sold and bought.

### Small Shop class: 
Small Shop class is the controller class of the project. It has some methods to perform operations.

### Main Class: 
The main class has one object and it calls the small shop class that handles all the operation.
